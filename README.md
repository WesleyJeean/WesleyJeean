### 👋 Hello 

I am a Systems Analyst and Developer in training, with a focus on web development, backend and system integration. I am very interested in scalable systems, process automation, artificial intelligence and the application of good software engineering practices from the initial stages of development.
I am currently specializing in modern tools such as JavaScript, React, FastAPI and Python, while also deepening my knowledge in algorithms, data structures, databases and system architecture.
I am driven by challenges and believe that technology, when well applied, has the power to transform realities and optimize processes, creating solutions that generate real impact.
